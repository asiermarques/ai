# 4. Memory Management

## Models
- **Semantic & Episodic Memory**  
  Stores factual knowledge and lived interaction history.
- **Salience & Recency Weighting**  
  Prioritizes important or recent memories for better retrieval.
- **Automatic Decay**  
  Removes outdated/low-value memories to prevent drift.
- **Multiple Embeddings (optional)**  
  Captures different semantic angles of a memory.
- **Explainable Recall Paths**  
  Shows why a memory was retrieved for transparency/debugging.

## Cognitive Operations
- **Pattern Clustering**  
  Groups similar memories to reduce noise.
- **Memory Consolidation**  
  Merges duplicates and strengthens consistent information.
- **Context Summaries**  
  Compresses interaction history into compact summaries.
- **Sector-aware Retrieval**  
  Retrieves only memories relevant to the task domain.
- **Associative Recall**  
  Connects memories across sectors to generate insights.

## Essential Additions
- **Memory Permissions**  
  Controls which agents/tools may access memory sectors.
- **Memory Versioning**  
  Tracks memory changes over time for audits.
- **Conflict Resolution**  
  Handles contradictory or competing memories.
- **Memory Validity Scoring**  
  Scores memories by reliability, freshness, and source quality.
